# TouristGuide

The tourist guide application enables users to locate distinct places to visit. They get a detailed description of the site along with the nearby places that they can see. Using this application, the user can select a location to see and get all information regarding that place.

Whether it’s bus stations, restaurants, hotel rooms, famous places, or the site’s history, all you can get in the same place. The Android Tourist Guide App design is entirely interactive and smooth and allows the user to figure out things quickly.

Now, let’s see the flow of the application.

The flow of the application:
You should design a Home screen where you have the following:

A search bar
A Recycler view or List view holding various city names.
Using the search bar, the users should be able to search their desired city of visit. Now you should design a city menu screen from which users can select one of the following to explore:

Hotel Rooms
Restaurants
Famous Places
Bus Stations
History of City
Whenever a user selects any of the above, you need to redirect him to the respective activity.

Suppose if he selected hotel rooms, you should show the hotels present in that city. In addition, you should add the address of the hotel there along with the phone number.
